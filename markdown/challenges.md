### 1. Open Ended

Do whatever the heck you want! We're sure it's gonna be cool üë©‚Äçüíª 

> Note: if you do a company challenge, you may also submit to this challenge. But if you do TD challenge 2-4, you *may not* also submit to this challenge.

**How We Judge**

- *Purpose*: Communicated a clear understanding of the problem
- *Framework*: Mapped the task to a data science problem
- *Data Use*: Effectively used data, acquired additional data
- *Models & Analytics*: Effective application of analytics
- *Validation*: Assessed quality of solutions & models
- *Impact*: Clear description of impact of solution to solving problem
- *Oral Presentation*: Effectiveness, engagement, and team performance

### 2. Stock Prediction (Advanced) 
Can you predict the future of stock? We recommend using reinforcement learning but do whatever works best!

**How We Judge**

You'll submit your machine learning model to a link we will provide. You're project will solely be judged on your model's performance (how much money your model makes) on unseen stock time series data.

### 3. Workshop Recommendations (Intermediate) 

**[Starter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B6L_AHQ1fQzq6clGf5jgLWvM6gn_Xxad?usp=sharing)**

TD wants to make a *For-You* page on tamudatathon.com that is personalized to every attendee. Can you use the TAMU Datathon data to make this possible?

> **Some Ideas (but you don't have to do these)**
>
> - Participant Achievement Dashboard (Visualization)
- Recommending Workshops (Supervised Learning)
- Team Building (Clustering)
- Workshops Search Engine (Natural Language Processing)


**How We Judge**

This is an open-ended challenge but and you can do whatever you want! We will judge on the percieved value of your solution to future datathon particpants.

## 4. Post-Grad Mover Tool (Beginner) 
There are a lot of factors that go into making a big move, and for many people, the top priority is either their job or their family. But if you‚Äôre on your own and you have job flexibility to go basically wherever you want (i.e. you work remotely), then what? In that case, you have the luxury of finding a place that suits you‚Äîand not necessarily just your career.

A myriad of decisions go into picking the perfect place to call home ‚Äî political leanings, crime rates, walkability, affordability, religious affiliations, weather and more ‚Äî can you make a tool that allows aggie graduates and others to find thier next move?

[High speed internet](https://www.highspeedinternet.com/best-cities-to-live-work-remotely) (of all people?!) made a tool to do this.... but you can do better! Think of more factors: like median income of a location, cuisine, primary ethnicity, pollution index, happiness index, number of coffee shops or microbreweries in the city, etc. There's no end! Furthermore, maybe you are an international student and want to make this tool for global placement! Go for it! Maybe you want to penalize distance from POI's (points of interest) like family. Do it! The world is your oyster!
