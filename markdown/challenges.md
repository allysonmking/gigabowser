Note: if you do a company challenge, you can also submit to this challenge.

### Metrics We Judge On- **Purpose**: Communicated a clear understanding of the problem- **Framework**: Mapped the task to a data science problem- **Data Use**: Effectively used data, acquired additional data- **Models & Analytics**: Effective application of analytics- **Validation**: Assessed quality of solutions & models- **Impact**: Clear description of impact of solution to solving problem- **Oral Presentation**: Effectiveness, engagement, and team performance

## 2. Stock Challenge (Advanced)
Can you predict the future of stock? We recommend using reinforcement learning but do whatever works best!

### Metrics We Judge On
You'll submit your machine learning model to a link we will provide. You're project will solely be judged on your model's performance (how much money your model makes) on unseen stock time series data.

## 3. TD Recommendation Engine (Intermediate)
Can you make a Netflix for TD workshops?? The idea is this... we‚Äôve received hundreds of natural language queries about what kind of workshops people want... I‚Äôm reading these thinking, we have a workshop for that, if I could just tell these people... So the challenge is a Netflix for our worshops. We have data on our applicants (PII removed), workshop metadata, who attended what workshops and natural language queries we've recieved. If successful, we will use this for the future of datathon!

### Metrics We Judge On
We will provide a test dataset of 100 queries which your model should submit workshop suggestions for. You will submit these suggestions to a Kaggle competition link we will provide. We will judge your recommendations based on MAP (mean average precision) criteria.

## 4. Weather Data (Beginner)
Beginner but no less awesome. Pollution effects all of our lives, to varying degrees but do we really know why or how? In this challenge, you will use your skills of exploratory data anlysis (EDA) and visualization to explain why pollution happens and how it effects peoples' lives. Looking for your own datasets get's you serious bonus points.
