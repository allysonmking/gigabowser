## 1. Open Ended 

Do whatever the heck you want! I know it's gonna be cool üë©‚Äçüíª 

Note: if you do a company challenge, you can also submit to this challenge.

#### How We Judge- **Purpose**: Communicated a clear understanding of the problem- **Framework**: Mapped the task to a data science problem- **Data Use**: Effectively used data, acquired additional data- **Models & Analytics**: Effective application of analytics- **Validation**: Assessed quality of solutions & models- **Impact**: Clear description of impact of solution to solving problem- **Oral Presentation**: Effectiveness, engagement, and team performance

## 2. Stock Prediction (Advanced) 
Can you predict the future of stock? We recommend using reinforcement learning but do whatever works best!

#### How We Judge
You'll submit your machine learning model to a link we will provide. You're project will solely be judged on your model's performance (how much money your model makes) on unseen stock time series data.

## 3. Workshop Recommendations (Intermediate) 
Can you make a Netflix for TD workshops? The idea is this: we‚Äôve received hundreds of natural language queries about what kind of workshops people want... turns out our workshops actually cover many of these things - people just don't know it! We have data on our applicants (PII removed), workshop metadata, who attended what workshops and natural language queries we've recieved. If you're successful, we will use your solution for the future of datathon! The challenge has two parts:

1. **Recommendation Engine** - Here, you will use data we have about what workshops about 100 of TD applicants attended. We will withold the data from 50 other applicants about what workshops they attended. You will try to predict what workshops they are most likely to attend.
2. **Search Engine** - Here, you will create a search engine that should return a workshop for a given query. We will withhold 50 (query, workshop) pairs for testing.

#### How We Judge
For both the recommendation and search engine, you will submit your answers on the test set to Kaggle. You will submit these suggestions to a Kaggle competition link we will provide. We will judge your recommendations based on MAP (mean average precision) criteria.

## 4. Pollution Data (Beginner) 
Beginner but no less awesome. Pollution effects all of our lives, to varying degrees but do we really know why or how? In this challenge, you will use your skills of exploratory data anlysis (EDA) and visualization to explain why pollution happens and how it effects peoples' lives. Looking for your own datasets get's you serious bonus points.

#### How We Judge- **Purpose**: Communicated a clear understanding of the problem- **Framework**: Mapped the task to a data science problem- **Data Use**: Effectively used data, acquired additional data- **Models & Analytics**: Effective application of analytics- **Validation**: Assessed quality of solutions & models- **Impact**: Clear description of impact of solution to solving problem- **Oral Presentation**: Effectiveness, engagement, and team performance
